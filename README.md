Game title: Snakey Game

Snakey Game is inspired in the original SNAKE game. This game could be found in most of 2000's 
flip phones, where you only needed 4 keys to move the snake. The main point of the game is to eat as much food 
as possible witout colliding into the walls or to itself. Evaluating the game mechanics, I implemented the game 
with funcitons provided to evaluate movement, collisions, growth, etc. 

The game was called Snakey Game, trying to diffirentiate the name from the original 'Snake game', therefore, it is not a typo.

NOTE**: There is no reference link since I already knew the game instructions for Snake and always wanted to create one. 
Nevertheless, the games has been made before. However, the implementation of the game is solely, purly mine.
